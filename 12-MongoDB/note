MongoDB learnning note:

the whole mongoDB is a document(JSON) collection
each entity(tables in RDB) is a document

the concept of namespace

in mongoDB all documents are encoded as BSON: binary JSON

mongoose as a helper

define the schema in a JSON fashion - hierachiecal = nested json

models power the DB operations
