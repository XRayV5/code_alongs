UI desing

1. start with mockup
2. better start with normalized CSS??






note:
header tag can be anywhere, not necessarily to be at the top

css:line-height: room or cushion between the lines

css: inline-block element: by default they have padding the bottom, use vertical-align
  to fix it
css: vertical-align only effects inline-block elements

.right {
  float: right; //to put things side by side, this trick always works!
}

wingdings ideal for small icons: qoute unicode

css selector: parent > children : this means selecting all direct children

Q:
img tags are inline-block by default???
