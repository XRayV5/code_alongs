  <p>
          Write a function 'grannyTalk' what takes a question as an argument and returns a string as her response.

      If you talk to Granny normally, she'll reply "SPEAK UP SONNY JIM"

      If you talk to her in ALL CAPS, she'll reply "NO, NOT SINCE 1945"

      The year will be a random year between 1930 and 1950.

      If you say "BYE" to her she'll reply "What's that honey, I didn't hear you.."

      bonus: write an additional function 'grandpaTalk' that when called, will call granny for you and interpret her responses incorrectly by swapping vowels randomly in the words of her responses.

      sample output of grandpaTalk:
  </p>
  <input type="text">
<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js">
</script>
</body>
</html>
