Lunch Orders

It's approaching lunch hourâ€¦ let's collect orders. Create a new file called lunch_orders.rb to complete this exercise.

Create a program that collects lunch orders. Prompt:
Name for order: (enter name)
{name} wants to order: (enter item)

Store the name/order data.
When storing data, do it in such a way that additional order items may be added for the person's name.

Example: Greg can order a Burger, and then add Fries to his order later.
After storing data, prompt the user with:
Add another item to the order? (y/n)
Repeat steps 1 & 2 if the answer is "y"
After the user completes adding orders, print out:
"All orders: {order data}"
Keep going...

Rather than printing out a blob of raw lunch order data, print each name's orders on a separate line, formatted as one of the following:

"Greg ordered a sandwich"
"Peter ordered a burger & fries"
"Travis ordered a salad, apple & water"
You may have to do some hunting in Ruby docs!
